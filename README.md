DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER ENGINEERING
SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCES
COLLEGE OF BASIC & APPLIED SCIENCES
FIRST SEMESTER 2021/2022 ACADEMIC YEAR

Course Code and Title: CPEN 103 - Computer Engineering Innovations


Course overview: 

This course introduces students to innovative thinking and engineering innovation practices using case studies, guest lectures, and projects that solve local and global problems. This course helps students to identify thematic areas of computer engineering innovation through experiential
learning, creative methods, innovation culture, and the importance of teamwork in engineering
innovation. Students will be exposed to entrepreneurship. Hands-on projects and guest lectures will equip students with practical skillsets to problem solving

Course Objectives: 

The course objectives include guiding students to design an innovative system, provide basic knowledge in computer engineering, create interest among computer engineers to build their own engineering and technical project to meet desired needs. 

Learning Outcomes:	

A student who completes the course successfully will be able to: 

	Identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems 

	Function on multidisciplinary teams

	Use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice.

	Conduct experiments, as well as analyze and interpret data

	 Understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context
